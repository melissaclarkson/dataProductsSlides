## About articulations

Bones which connect to each other through a joint are said to "articulate". Skeletal cartilage, such as the costal cartilages of the ribs, also articulate with bones.

---

## The articulation data

The list of articulations in this data file comes from the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) ontology, which is a representation of human anatomy in a form that is both human-readable and computer-parsable. 

I performed a SPARQL query over the FMA to retrieve all pairs of articulations. I then manually annotated the each line of the file to add the region of the skeleton. This allows the user to select a region of the skeleton for which to list the articulations.

---

## Code demo

Here are the seven regions of the skeleton I annotated:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
    artData <- read.csv("FMA_articulations.csv")
    skeletalRegions <- unique(artData$region)
    skeletalRegions
   
```

## The final app looks like this...
